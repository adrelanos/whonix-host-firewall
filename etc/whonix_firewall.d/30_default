## Torify Gateway / Hide the fact, that you are a Whonix user ##
################################################################

## For ensuring, that the Whonix-Workstation can only send traffic through Tor,
## it would not be required to route Whonix-Gateways traffic through Tor as well.
## Torifying the Whonix-Gateway prevents your ISP from knowing you are a Whonix user.
##
## This does NOT prevent your ISP from knowing you are a Tor user.
##    If you want this, read:
##    https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Hide_Tor_and_Whonix_from_your_ISP
##
## Torifying the Gateway has the disadvantage, that apt-get operating system updates
## are slower. It also makes testing, developing and all kinds of special non-stock
## configurations more complicated. You can optionally disable this feature.
##
## Experts only! There is also the user clearnet on the Whonix-Gateway, which
## is allowed to make non-Tor connections.
##
## Allow (1) or forbid (0) the root user on the Whonix-Gateway to make non-Tor connections.
## Experts only!
ALLOW_GATEWAY_ROOT_USER=0
## Allow (1) or forbid (0) the user user on the Whonix-Gateway to make non-Tor connections.

## A port forwarding from the host to the Whonix-Gateway has still to be created,
